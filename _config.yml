  Hi! I am a postdoc researcher currently working in the <a href='https://sites.uclouvain.be/goffauxlab/index.html'>goffauxlab</a> @UCLouvain, Belgium where I conduct research on (human) visual perception. One of the goals of my research is to better understand how coarse and fine visual signals are integrated in the brain. I am particularly interested in how these mechanisms are implemented in animals with foveated vision (such as humans), which consists of a large visual field with only a tiny region that allows for high spatial resolution. <br>
  
  In the past I have worked on the coarse-to-fine approach of visual perception. My PhD research focused on how peripheral vision contributes to coarse visual signals. In my current position @goffauxlab, I also collaborate on research aimed at better understanding how basic visual features (oriented contrast) are encoded and lead to face perception. <br> More recently, I've become interested in the radial organisation of the visual field, which appears to be present in at least some species with foveated vision. I received a FSR grant from UCLouvain to investigate how this visual bias influences how we perceive natural objects such as faces.<br>
  I mostly use psychophysics, which is my favourite tool, and I am working on shifting toward Bayesian statistical models to analyse the non-linear perceptual phenomena that psychophysical experiments often measure (e.g., psychometric functions, gaussian tuning functions).
